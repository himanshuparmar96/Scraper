Protection is required from the additional hypoxic conditions resulting from environmental pollution, Occupational related diseases, life style related diseases due to acculturization and high altitude related diseases. LIP over the years have carried out detailed epidemiological studies on these subjects and applied interventions to safeguard the population\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health and environment. \r\nLIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution towards environmental health: Through its action on smoking and health it has been able to reduce prevalence of smoking in adult male from 42 % in 1988 to 8% in 2010.  This intervention has reduced incidence of acute coronary artery disease and lung cancer. Through our clinical, epidemiological, radiological, environmental and histo-pathological study, we identified mixed dust pneumoconiosis (Silicosis and coal worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s type of pneumoconiosis) in the Indus belt population of Ladakh (Thorax 1991;46;341-343) and domestic pollution and respiratory illness in the Himalayan population (International Journal of epidemiology 1991;vol20;No3;749-757). The intervention practiced following it has improved the respiratory health of the population.\r\n LIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution in screening of the population in life style related diseases (Non-communicable diseases and cancer)   During the last thirty years, Leh town have been colonized by rural people representing most of the villages of Ladakh. These population are now adopting a western model of life style threatening an impending disease of the new millennium. LIP did an extensive study (comprehensive health camp with service provision and health awareness campaign) in all the subdivisions of Ladakh on the prevalence of Non-communicable diseases from 2007-2011. The results on Prevalence of hypertension and diabetes have been published in BMJ open (2015;5:e007026) and (BMJ open;2016;6:e009728). Based on these works, LIP has distributed booklet and CD (in local language) on living \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Healthy life style\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. LIP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s works on screening of HBsAg (hepatitis B) in over 5000 subjects throughout the district has enlightened the population in getting the hepatitis B (HBsAg) negative subjects to receive full course of vaccine. Those with carriers of hepatitis B are being followed up and those needing anti-viral treatment are being supported by LIP. This activity will certainly reduce cancer of the liver. Through its medical and health awareness interventions the prevalence of stomach cancer has been reduced from 25 per one lakh population in 1997 to 8-10 per one lakh at present.\r\nDeficiency diseases in rural Ladakh.  For the last five years, Lip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health camps have focused on deficiency disease like Iron deficiency anemia, Vitamin D insufficiency, micro and macronutrient status in rural population of Ladakh. It has used validated questionnaires and hematological and biochemical assays (Hb, PBF; serum ferritin, Vitamin B12, folic acid, TSH) to determine the nutritional status particularly in Zanskar subdivision. Service provision and health education done simultaneously is proving effective in ameliorating these problems.\r\nMother and child health. LIP is currently trying to establish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mother and child health care through a mother and child health handbook system\u00e2\u20ac\u009d wherein the health of the mother from the first day of antenatal check-up to 9 months post pregnancy and the child from birth till 6 year will be documented in the hand book. We have so far documented 3000 mother and child under this system.\r\nHigh altitude adaptation. LIP is currently studying prevalence of chronic mountain sickness (CMS) in populations living at higher altitude (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 3800 meters). This study will help not only to understand the factors leading to loss of adaptation (CMS) but also hypoxia related diseases like Dementia, cancers, lung and heart diseases.
